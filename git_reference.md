# Git reference

## Initialise a new repository
* open the terminal
* navigate to the folder you want the project to be
* run `git init`

## Commit changes
* run `git add .` to add all the files to *staging* (on commit, all and only files on staging will be saved)
* run `git commit -m 'thing that you have done'` to create a commit (a snapshot of your code) at this point in time, with a comment explaining what changed
